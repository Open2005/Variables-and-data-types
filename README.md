In many jurisdictions, a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people to recycle them. In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or less have a $0.10 deposit and drink containers holding more than one liter have a $0.25 deposit. Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size(less and more)  from the user. Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign and always displays exactly two decimal places.

Sample Input

10

20

Sample Output

Your total refund will be $6.00.
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=(a*0.10)+(b*0.25)
print("Your total refund will be $","{:.2f}".format(c),".",sep="")
Justin is a carpenter who works on an hourly basis. He works in a company where he is paid Rs 50 for an hour on weekdays and Rs 80 for an hour on weekends. He works 10 hrs more on weekdays than weekends. If the salary paid for him is given, write a program to find the number of hours he has worked on weekdays and weekends.

Hint:

If the final result(hrs) are in -ve convert that to +ve using abs() function

The abs() function returns the absolute value of the given number.


number = -20
absolute_number = abs(number)
print(absolute_number)
# Output: 20

Sample Input:

450

Sample Output:

weekdays 10.38

weekend 0.38



For example:

Input	Result
450
weekdays 10.38
weekend 0.38

k2=round(ans,2)+10
print("weekdays","{:.2f}".format(k2))
print("weekend","{:.2f}".format(k1))
